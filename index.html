        <h1> i want summer</h1>
        <h4>by cass</h4>
        <br> <br>
        <p><em>many people love <strong>fall</strong><br> but I think it dropped the <strong>ball</strong></em></p>
        <p><em>I love the <strong> spring</strong> <br> its when people start going back on a <strong>swing</strong></em></p>
        <p><em>i am very very very <strong>tired</strong> <br> Id love to be able to get <strong>fired</strong></em></p>
        <p> <em>school is fun but sometimes <strong>boring</strong> <br> I really hate the sound of <strong>snoring</strong></em></p>
        <p><em>I'd love to swim in the <strong>bay</strong> <br> or get a nice tan by them bright <strong>rays</strong></em></p>
        <p><em>at night, familys have a <strong>fire</strong> <br> they cook steak and eat it with no <strong>worcheshire</strong> </em></p>
        <p> <em> although this poem has come to an <strong>end</strong> <br> i hope you find in you to be my <strong>friend</strong> </em></p>
